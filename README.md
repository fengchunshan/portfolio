Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similar (or the same) questions. Various questions with the same intent can cause people to spend extra time searching for the best answer to their question, and results in members answering multiple versions of the same question.

It also offer a machine learning-based search feature. Through this feature, a user can enter a question function and the model will return the most similar question to it, or a NAN if none exist.
